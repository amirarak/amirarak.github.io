  <h2>Personal Info</h2>
  <p>Hi! My name is Rakieva Amira. I'm 17 years old. I am the middle child in my family, <br> I have an older sister and a younger brother.
    I am currently a first year student at Ala-Too International University.<br> My motto in life: "It is better to do and not regret than not to do and regret."</p>
    <p> In my free time, I like to have picnics, read books, watch various shows, bake different desserts and just spend time with my family.I speak four languages: Kyrgyz, Russian, English and Turkish. Now I'm learning French, I also want to learn Chinese.
        I always liked learning something new. Now I'm interested in psychology. 
        I love Harry Potter movies, I can watch them at least a hundred times. My favorite genres are romance, fantasy, historical. I hate horror movies because I'm very afraid to watch them. 
        I love reading science fiction books because it's impossible to predict what will happen next. I'm not picky about food. I can eat everything except broccoli. I love Turkish cuisine. My weakness is sweets, especially baklava with ice cream.
        I am an introvert. I may seem very quiet at first, but after a while I get used to the person. I am cheerful, responsive, responsible and calm.</p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
 <p> My hobbies are dancing and swimming. Since childhood, I attended national dance classes, and soon changed <br> to modern dances. Unfortunately, now I no longer go to dance lessons, but I dance according to my mood. I started swimming at the age of 12. I did not attend classes, my father<br> taught me. I like swimming very much, for me it is meditation.Swimming gives me a sense of calm.I have a talent for oratory. I can say it's hereditary. My dad is a public person, <br> so public speaking is part of his job. At school, I always composed the script myself and conducted all the events.</p>
